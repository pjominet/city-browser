# City Browser

## About

This is a JQuery/Bootstrap Project done at the University of Cologne. It is a semester
work as part of the "BSI1"-course.

This is a simple city browser app, that queries data from an xml file. Additionally
some live weather data from openweathermap.org will be queried and displayed alongside.
