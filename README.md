# City Browser

## About

This is a simple city browser app, that queries data from an xml file. Additionally
some live weather data from openweathermap.org will be queried and displayed alongside
the search results.

## Prerequisites

PHP 5.0 or higher

Rename `data/cities.xml.template` to `cities.xml` to ensure proper functionality. 

You may populate `cities.xml` in advance to have baseline data to fetch.
